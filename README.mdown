# The Session data

CSV and JSON files of data from [The Session](https://thesession.org/):

* [tunes](https://thesession.org/tunes/),
* [sessions](https://thesession.org/sessions/),
* [events](https://thesession.org/events/),
* [recordings](https://thesession.org/recordings/),
* [sets of tunes](https://thesession.org/tunes/sets),
* aliases of tune names,
* popularity of tunes.

I'll try to update the files once a week.

If anyone wants to convert the data to other formats, feel free to fork the project and send me a pull request.
