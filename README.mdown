# The Session data

CSV and JSON files of data from [The Session](https://thesession.org/):

* [tunes](https://thesession.org/tunes/),
* [sessions](https://thesession.org/sessions/),
* [events](https://thesession.org/events/),
* [recordings](https://thesession.org/recordings/),
* aliases of tune names,
* [sets of tunes](https://thesession.org/tunes/sets),
* popularity of tunes.

I'll try to update the files once a week.

If anyone wants to convert the data to other formats, feel free to fork the project and send me a pull request.

## Exploring the data

You can explore this data at
<https://thesession.vercel.app/>

This interface, powered by [Datesette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette), allows you to run SQL commands on the data. The results of those SQL commands are also available as CSV and JSON.

Because the JSON output of your SQL commands have a URL, you can use those URLs as API endpoints.
